        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Being a native and long time resident of the Gulf Coast I have been witness to the growth and productivity that networking and marketing via the web bring. Whether it be connecting devastated rural communities to emergency resources for efficient access and information, or growing a small business into worldwide destination, the web is invaluable in the growth and prosperity of modern society.</p>
        <p>With an experienced background in restaurant management and all aspects pertaining thereto.  I can testify to how much more efficient a business can be with a great website, bold marketing, and a network of vendors to keep you supplied with everything you need to open the doors every morning.</p>
        <p>I am apiring to strengthen my skills in web development and design in order to bring this success and growth to others.  I seek to accomplish this only in a business context, but to improve the quality of life for others in whatever small way that I am able.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am moving forward to master the art of web development and design. Currently, I am seeking to increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in but not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In an employer, I am interested in working with a company that is ambitious in creating a strong online presence for our clients, and meeting their needs and concerns with creativity and efficiency.  I am confident that the friends and colleagues that would be gained from such an environment would go far to give me the tools I need not only to share in the company's endeavors, but to strengthen my skills as a developer. With the knowledge and networking gained from such an experience I will be ready to meet the many future challenges and changes that lie ahead in this field.</p>
